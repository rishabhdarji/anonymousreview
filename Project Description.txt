Portfolio description
You built a full stack anonymous feedback platform. Users create accounts and verify them through a six digit code. Each profile gets a public link where others send messages. You built strong validation, secure authentication, and a private dashboard for managing messages. You integrated a local large language model through Ollama to generate suggested questions for visitors. The system handles username checks, password rules, message deletion, and message acceptance state. The interface uses a dark theme with custom visuals.
